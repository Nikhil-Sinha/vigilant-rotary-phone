The above algorithm was written when I was doing my ML Course. 

In this problem we had to study our customers and analyse the points which can be targetted to improve our business.
1. We are given data from an audiobook app. Each customer has purchased a book or two from our app, thats the basic 
   conditon to be included.
2. We are to create a ML algorithm to predict if a customer will buy again from the audiobook company. The main idea is 
that the company should not spend their budget on targetting customers who are not likely to buy again.
3. Thus, we create this algorithm to better our business.
