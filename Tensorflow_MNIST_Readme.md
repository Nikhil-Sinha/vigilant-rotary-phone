MNIST Classification.
Our objective was to build an algorithm that takes in an image and correctly determines which number is shown in that image.
MNIST is the /"Hello world" of Machine Learning.

Reasons to select this :
  1. Very visual problem
  2. Extremely Common
  3. Easy to build up to CNN
  4. Dataset is Very big and Preprocessed
  
The MNIST action Plan :
  1. Prepare our dataset and preprocess it. Create training, Validation and Test Datasets
  2. Outline the model and choose the activation functions.
  3. Set the appropriate advanced optimizers and loss functions.
  4. Train the model.
  5. Test the accuracy of the model
