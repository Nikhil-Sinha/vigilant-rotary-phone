The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or cat.

Although the problem sounds simple, it was only effectively addressed in the last few years using deep learning convolutional neural
networks. 

While the dataset is effectively solved, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use 
convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification from scratch.

After completing this tutorial, i have learnt the following :

  1. How to load and prepare photos of dogs and cats for modeling.
  2. How to develop a convolutional neural network for photo classification from scratch and improve model performance.
  3. How to develop a model for photo classification using transfer learning.
