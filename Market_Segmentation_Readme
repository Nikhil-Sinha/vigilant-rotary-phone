Market Segmentation using Cluster Analysis.

In this dataset, we have data about a retail shop. There are 30 observations. Each of these observations are clients.

We have a score for each client based on their Satisfaction and Brand Loyalty.

"Satisfaction" was self-reported within a range of 1-10, with '10' being "Very Satisfied"
      Type of Data : Discrete, int values
      Range : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
"Brand Loyalty" there is no widely accecpted technique to measure it but there are proxies like churn rate, retention rate or 
customer lifetime value (CLV)
       Loyalty = # purchases for 1year + other factors.
       Type of Data : Continuous
       Range  : (-2.5 to 2.5)
